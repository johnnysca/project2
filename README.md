move either right one or down one. You may not move up, nor left, nor may you move more
than one spot at once. You may not stand still at any iteration.
The board contains positives, negatives, P or D. A positive number increases your health by the specified amount on the cell, negative decreases your health by the specified amount,
P is a potion that you can use to negate damage at a cell (1 time use only)
D is a potion that you can use to double health points by the specified amount at the current cell (1 time use only).

top-left to the bottom-right corner while never having fewer than one HP
